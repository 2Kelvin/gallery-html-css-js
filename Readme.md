#Gallery

A simple **responsive** gallery built using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

- One can click on a picture to view it in full size.

- The gallery is efficient in a way that it uses a forEach loop to loop through an array of images and create div and img elements for them to be displayed in the website.
